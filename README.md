# batect/zsh-completion

[![Pipeline](https://github.com/batect/zsh-completion/workflows/Pipeline/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/batect/zsh-completion/actions?query=workflow%3APipeline+branch%3Amain)

Shell tab completions for [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/).

## Requirements

* [Batect](https://batect.dev) v0.66 or later in your project
* [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) v5.8 or later

## Installing

### With [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```
brew install batect/batect/batect-zsh-completion
```

## How this works

In order to enable multiple projects to co-exist with different versions of Batect (and corresponding different available options), the completion script
in this repository acts as a proxy to the completion script generated by the appropriate version of Batect.

[The original RFC for shell tab completion](https://github.com/batect/batect/blob/master/rfcs/2020-03-shell-tab-completion/proposal.md) has further explanation.

## Useful references

The manual for Zsh's completion system is quite detailed and isn't a great tutorial. These articles were useful when building this:

For [the testing script](.batect/test-env/complete.zsh), these served as inspiration:
